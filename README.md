A distributed air traffic control system for commercial drones.

## Abstract

The rapid growth in commercial drone usage for various applications, such as delivery, surveillance, and agriculture, necessitates a robust and scalable air traffic control system. This paper proposes a distributed air traffic control system specifically designed for commercial drones. The system leverages advanced communication protocols, collision avoidance algorithms, and real-time airspace management to ensure efficient and safe drone operations. We discuss the critical components of the proposed system, address potential challenges, and explore the benefits of adopting a distributed approach to managing commercial drone traffic.
